# Creating a Virtual Environment

Explicitly define a Python3 working environment

## Introduction

Explicit is better than implicit, define your dependencies:

* Multiple projects have multiple dependencies.  Same Python module cannot have to different versions.
* Development environment is different than production.  Create an environment that is automatically reproducible.

## Virtualenv Module

Sets up a virtual enviornmet so none of the installed dependencises will be shared with the version of Python installed on the machine.  *Virtualenv is automatically installed in Python3, but not Python2*

## Instructions

How to create a virtualenv for Python:

1. Change directory to the root directory of the project
2. Enter the following command.  *This creates a subdirectory called .venv that contains the virtualenv*:

```
python -m venv .venv
```

3. Note the following information for reference before activating the venv:

```
pip --version
which python3
```

4. Activate the virtual environment.  *If the venv is active the prompt will change to (.venv).  Using pryton -m venv --prompt option can create a unique prompt other than directory name for venv*:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

5. Note the following information for reference after activating the venv.  *pip can be independently upgraded from host OS in environment using pip install --upgrade pip command.*  *No longer need to specify python3 in venv since python2 is not an option* :

```
pip --version
which python
```

6. Exit the venv using the following command:

```
deactivate
```

7. Clean up the virtual envirnment by removing the .venv directory:

```
rm -rf .venv
```
